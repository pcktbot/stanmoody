            <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a native Oregonian and grew up in Albany Oregon. Early in my life I was involved in BMX racing. As I grew older I began playing golf and skateboarding. At age 13 I was introduced to snow skiing and quickly made the transition to snowboarding. The more time I spent snowboarding the more addicted to the sport I became. I began working a part time jobs to support my habit. I had two season passes to Hoodoo and also frequently went to Willamette Pass, all three resorts on Mt. Hood and Mt. Bachelor. Snowboarding became a year-round sport for me, spending my summers at Timberline on the glacier riding the public parks. My friends and I were frequently caught attempting to poach High Cascade and Windell's private parks. Skateboarding continued to be another one of my favorite past times. When I couldn't be snowboarding, I was skateboarding. </p>  
            
            <p>After finishing high school I moved to Bend Oregon to attend Central Oregon Community College and continue skateboarding and snowboarding as much as possible. Bend was the ideal place for me to enjoy doing the sports I loved, while going to school. To this day I still love living in Central Oregon. Adult life has slowed down my board sport habit. I am currently on my 17th consecutive year as a Mt. Bachelor season pass holder and still try to get up there as much as possible. In the summer, I still skate a little, but growing old has caused me to move towards past times with less physical consequences. When the weather is warm I also enjoy golfing and floating the river. </p>
            
        <h2> Why I Enjoy Living in Central Oregon</h2>
            <p>There is just so many fun things to do in Central Oregon year-round. Plenty of golf course to choose from and lots of great craft breweries. So many mountains and lakes close by. Endless amounts of hiking and biking trails make this area an epic outdoor play ground. The drier climate makes it much easier to enjoy the outdoors compared to living in the western part of the state.
